# figma-prototype-Jensen

As part of my internship, I was assigned project by my mentor to design a prototype for the "For Businesses" section of the schoolâ€™s website. This was a creative and independent task where I was responsible for developing a fully responsive design. The aim was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that adapts well to various screen sizes and devices.
